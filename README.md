# SVG-CSS-To-Cartesian-Converter

Designed to take in both SVG and CSS data about a shape, and spit out the cartesian coordinates of each actual vertex. Honestly made to make converting shapes from Photohop/Illustrator easier. Triangle Strip only works for 4 sided shapes and just swaps the 3rd and 4th coordinates so you don't manually have to. Also adds .0 to the end of each coordinate because thats the format I needed them in. Honestly I whipped this up because it was convenient for something else I was doing
